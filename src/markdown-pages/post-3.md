Spring break started, and for many, never ended. COVID-19 lockdowns ushered us into summer, and most schools delayed reopening until the fall. While it might sound like a dream come true for a child, the reality isn’t so glamorous.

We aren’t vacationing. We aren’t hitting up the water parks. Heck, we aren’t even venturing out to the library or local playground. With the risk of coronavirus looming overhead, the majority of us are spending as much time as possible at home.

Spending days on end at home was a novel idea — at first. We got to tackle long put-off projects, bake with the kids, take leisurely walks around the neighborhood, and really enjoy slowing down.

Now, days are running together, we’ve watched everything on Netflix AND Disney+, and our kids are literally climbing the walls.

How can families continue to practice safe physical distancing, also known as social distancing, while maintaining an active lifestyle? Here are six activities parents and kids can do together to keep fit while having fun at home this summer
Do some spring (ahem, summer) cleaning

Yes, you probably already completed a mile-long list of projects your first 2 weeks at home. But surely you’ve got many more still waiting.

It’s time to turn up the music, hand your kids a broom, and get to cleaning. Get everyone involved — toddlers to teens! Delegate age-appropriate chores and make it fun.

Reward everyone for a job well done with pizza and a movie at the end of a long week. This is a great way to keep the whole family productive and moving while remaining safe at home.
Take P.E. — the modern way

Just because school’s out doesn’t mean physical education needs to be. Thankfully with modern technology, you’ve got so many options for keeping your kids fit while having fun — and more often than not, for FREE!

Be sure to use the YouTube search bar for things like “family-friendly fitness,” “kids workout videos,” or “beginner yoga” and you’ll find more than you know what to do with. YouTube is truly a treasure trove of free exercise options for those of ALL ages.
Build an indoor obstacle course

If your kids love “American Ninja Warrior,” you know all about obstacle courses. It’s time to build your own at home.

Set up the kitchen chairs, couch cushions, pillows, blankets, and anything else you might have on hand and make your course as intricate and challenging as you’d like. Then, turn your kids loose and watch them go. Even better, take a turn yourself!

The best part about this is, you can do it every week and create a new course each time.

Want to do it up right? Make it a theme day.

Spend the morning plotting out and setting up your course. Let your budding designers draw it out on paper (and color it too!).
Then, once it’s all set up, get dressed in your best ninja warrior wear. Dress for success!
Once everyone is in costume, set the timer and get going. Take turns going through the course and see who ends up with the fastest time.
After you get it all cleaned up, let your kids participate in preparing a warrior-worthy meal. A fresh veggie tray, cubed cheese, deli meat, and crackers is simple, well-balanced, and quick to put together.
Lastly, cap off the night with an “American Ninja Warrior” marathon on TV. That screen time will be well deserved and enjoyed by all.

Creating an indoor obstacle course is a creative way to keep the family active in both body and mind while having a great time together.
Start a garden

Is starting a garden on your list of “someday” projects? Make that day today!

Yes, this will likely require a quick run to the store for some basic supplies, but otherwise is an activity that can be kept up with at home. Plus, you’ll reap the rewards long after the COVID-19 quarantine is over.

Gardening is a good choice for kids because it allows them to enjoy fresh air, take in some sunshine, and get their hands dirty. These things are great for boosting their immune system, building motor skills, and providing necessary sensory input.

It also teaches kids about where their food comes from and is a nifty way to incorporate hands-on science lessons since we’re all schooling at home right now.

Gardening is a practical way to keep your body active, your mind engaged, and grow something that will provide your family with food, fun, and sun for many years to come.
